This repository contains the analysis results of 50 audit reports, which aims to facilitate the review process of the paper "The Roadmap for DApp Analysis: A Large-Scale Dataset for Smart Contract Weakness Classification."

There are three parts of our dataset, i.e., an analysis report, audit reports, and the codes of DApps. 

Analysis.csv: The analysis.csv contains the analysis results. Each line in the document represents an SWC weakness with seven elements summarized from audit reports, i.e., the audit teamâ€™s name, DApp name, a summary of the weakness, the SWC type, its granularity, its location, and the weakness URL. The latter three elements were only provided for SWC weaknesses. 

audit: This file contains the selected audit reports for 50 projects. 

code:  This file contains the related source code of the audit reports. The file name of a project source code should be the same as its audit report.
